# LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning Workshop

Hands-on workshop organized by HES-SO Valais-Wallis and HEIG-VD as part of a Swiss AI Center cheque supported by Exoscale. Explore diverse use cases while learning how to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs), including data preparation, optimization, monitoring, scaling, deployment, interaction, and evaluation.

> **Note:** This is the `main` branch containing the source code. The documentation of the workshop itself is on the [`website`](https://github.com/ALIRE-HES-SO/llm-sft-workshop/tree/website) branch.
