# LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning Workshop

Hands-on workshop organized by [HES-SO Valais-Wallis](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/homepage) and [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/) as part of a [Swiss AI Center](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/swiss-ai-center) cheque supported by [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/). Explore diverse use cases while learning how to perform [supervised fine-tuning (SFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)) of [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), including data preparation, optimization, monitoring, scaling, deployment, interaction, and evaluation.
