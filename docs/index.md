Welcome, and thank you for your interest in this hands-on workshop organized by **[HES-SO Valais-Wallis](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/homepage)** and **[HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch)** as part of a **[Swiss AI Center](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/swiss-ai-center)** cheque supported by **[Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com)**!

By the end, you will understand the practical aspects of [fine-tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)) [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) using open-source tools and modern cloud infrastructure. You will know how to prepare datasets, train models efficiently from a single GPU to multi-GPU setups, track training progress, evaluate performance, deploy your model, and interact with it.
