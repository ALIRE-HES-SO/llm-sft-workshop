2. Include any relevant references to legal articles (prefixed with "Art.") and considerations (prefixed with "E." in German or "consid." in French/Italian).

3. Use precise legal terminology and adhere to the formal and professional style typical of Swiss Federal Supreme Court headnotes.

4. Ensure clarity and coherence, so the headnote is logically structured and easy to understand in the specified language.

Your response should consist solely of the headnote in the language specified by the user prompt.
